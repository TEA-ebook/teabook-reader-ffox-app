# Contributions are much welcome!

## If you are opening an issue:

### It should have:

- Precise, descriptive summaries
- Informative, concise descriptions
- A neutral tone, avoiding complaints or conjecture

### It should contain:

- The simplest steps to reproduce the issue, or...
- A failing test fixture for the bug

### Only one issue per report accompanied by:

- A detailed description of the issue focusing on the facts
- Expected and actual results
- Crash data, including stack traces, log files, screenshots and other relevant information

### Please search for duplicates before reporting a bug and ensure summaries include relevant keywords to make it easier for others to find duplicates.


## If you want to create a pull request:

- **Fork the repository and clone it locally.** Connect your local to the original ‘upstream’ repository by adding it as a remote. Pull in changes from ‘upstream’ often so that you stay up to date so that when you submit your pull request, merge conflicts will be less likely.
- **Create a branch** for your edits
- **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
- **It’s best to test.** Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the app.
- **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include differences in UI. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
- **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for us to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.
